# Wow, so, a few things about this calculator:
# 1. It's not really evil. I know it's titled so, yet, honestly, the only thing evil about it is the lack of functions / components.
# 2. in terms of interface, it's really just a grid sensitive to clicks, there aren't any buttons or anything - I was so excited to get to the programming part, I skimmed on the UI part. mia culpa
# 3. There are still quite a few issues with it.
# ------Issues with it:------
# a. too many numbers? the interface will get overrun xD
# b. if you do a+b=xyz, as you hit = you get the result right? Now if you click on MR... it deletes the result
# c. similarly to "b", you can use RND under certain circumstances to mess with the result
# 4. if you've noticed a shift from letters to numbers, that's just how serious it is: no functions, too manmy logic loops, it's really quite a disaster. when I was writing it, I didn't give much thought to anything beyond "this is so much fun". spoiler alert: towards the end when I had to deal with the numerous issues, it became less fun. And so, ideally, this entire thing needs a rewrite. One that uses functions, and separate files. It's way too messy for something this simple.
# e. To be fair, this was more of a projec to do a project. I've studied react/js/css/html for a while and wanted to do something.
